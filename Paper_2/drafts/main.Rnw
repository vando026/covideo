\subsection*{Introduction}

A large amount of published health information about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has
been disseminated by the traditional mass media since the outbreak of the
pandemic.\citep{Cinelli2020,Kouzy2020,Mian2020a} However, it is not clear if this
information has improved knowledge of preventive COVID-19 behaviours. By preventive
behaviours, we mean the public's adoption of practices such as social distancing and hand
sanitation (among others) that can reduce the spread of COVID-19. 

Arguably, one possible limitation of mainstream mass media is that it is perceived
as politicized and culturally localized, thus limiting the persuasiveness of health
messages about COVID-19.\citep{Garfin2020a, Garrett2020} It is also likely that
traditional mass media channels (e.g., local or national television networks) have missed
key segments of the population, such as young people (18--35 years) who are
disproportionately more likely to transmit the virus.\citep{Dowd2020, Harris2020,
Zhao2020} An effective public health response could benefit from the rapid distribution of
entertainment-education (E-E) approaches through social media channels to a diverse and
global audience.\citep{Hahn2020, Block2020} 

We have designed a short, wordless, and animated E-E video to improve knowledge of
preventive COVID-19 behaviours.  The E-E video was released on Stanford Medicine's YouTube
channel on March 21, 2020 and reached 332,000 views on YouTube, 220,000 views on
Instagram, 294,000 views on Facebook, and 402,000 views on Twitter, with a cumulative
count of 1.2 million views within 10 days.\citep{Adam2020} Using a randomized
controlled trial (RCT), we evaluate the E-E video's effectiveness among online participants from
the United States of America (USA), Mexico, the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, and Spain. 


\subsection*{Methods}

\paragraph{Study design and participants} 

This was a multi-site, parallel group, RCT comparing the effectiveness of the E-E video
against an attention placebo control (APC) video and do-nothing.\citep{Vandormael2020b} We
used an online platform called Prolific Academic (\url{https://www.prolific.co}) to enroll
participants on a ``first come, first served'' basis. Participant eligibility included
being  18 to 59 years of age (male, female, or other), having residence in the USA, the UK,
Germany, Spain, or Mexico, and having proficiency in English, German, or Spanish. The
trial was hosted and deployed on Gorilla (\url{www.gorilla.sc}), which is a cloud platform
that provides versatile tools to undertake online, experimental, and behavioural
research.\citep{Anwyl-Irvine2020} The study and its outcomes were registered at the German
Clinical Trials Register (www.drks.de) on May 12th, 2020: \#DRKS00021582. Ethical approval
was obtained from the Stanford University IRB on April 12, 2020, \#55820.    

\paragraph{Randomization and masking}

Randomization was at a 1:1:1 ratio for the three arms of the trial.  Because Prolific
Academic handled the interaction between the study investigators and participants, the
participants were completely anonymous to the study investigators. Participants
self-responded to the survey questions and self-submitted their responses anonymously on
the Gorilla platform. The study investigators were blinded to the group
allocation.\citep{Vandormael2020b} 


\paragraph{Procedures}

Participants began the online study on the Gorilla platform by answering basic demographic
questions about their age, sex, primary language, country of residence, and highest
education completed.

Participants were  then randomly assigned by Gorilla to the E-E video, APC, or do-nothing.
The E-E video describes how the novel coronavirus is spread (airborne, physical contact),
and recommends best practices to prevent or reduce the spread of COVID-19 (staying at
home, not congregating in public spaces, and sanitizing hands and surfaces). It also
covers the mass media coverage of the epidemic and a subplot about the stockpiling of
essential goods (\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAj38E7vrS8}).\citep{Adam2020}


The APC is also a wordless, animated video with the same duration as the E-E video.  Its
content describes how small choices become actions, which become habits, which become a
way of life (\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HEnohs6yYw}).  We included an APC to
account for possible attention effects elicited by the video medium. APC conditions should
mimic the ``inactive'' components of an interventionâ€”the effect of watching the
video---while not containing any of the ``active'' intervention components---the content
delivered by the video.\citep{Freedland2011} We did not make the assumption that the
E-E video is better than nothing (i.e., no video). It is possible that the E-E video could
motivate reactance to our COVID-19 prevention message.\citep{Dillard2005,Miller2007,
Richards2015} 


Participants answered 18 questions on preventive COVID-19 behaviors. All items required
True or False responses and all participants received the knowledge items. To prevent online
searching for answers, participants had a 30 second count-down to respond to each
item. To ensure post-trial access to treatment,\citep{Doval2015} participants in the
APC and do-nothing arm could choose to watch the E-E video at the end of the
study. 


\paragraph{Statistical analysis}


The primary outcome was the average number of correct answers to the 18 knowledge
questions.  For each participant, we created an overall knowledge score (minimum $=$ 0,
maximum $=$ 18) by adding the correctly answered items. We used an ordinary least squares
(OLS) regression to estimate the mean knowledge score by trial arm and to estimate the
difference in knowledge scores between trial arms. We defined the difference in mean
knowledge scores between the E-E video and do-nothing arms as the total effect, the
difference between the APC and do-nothing arms as the attention effect, and the difference
between the E-E video and APC arms as the content effect.  We also summarized the
participant characteristics by obtaining means and standard deviations of age, gender,
primary language, country of residence, and education status.  Statistical analyses were
performed with R software version 4.2.


\paragraph{Role of the funding source}

The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data
interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all
the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for
publication.

\subsection*{Results}


Between \Sexpr{res$dates[1]} and \Sexpr{res$dates[2]}, we enrolled \Sexpr{fmt(flow$In)}
participants through the Prolific Academic platform. A total of  \Sexpr{fmt(flow$In -
flow$Start)} participants were randomly assigned to the E-E video
(\Sexpr{fmt(flow$CoVidN)}), APC (\Sexpr{fmt(flow$APCN)}), and do-nothing
(\Sexpr{fmt(flow$CtrlN)}) arms (Figure \ref{fig:dataflow}).  Between recruitment and
randomization, \Sexpr{flow$Start} participants were lost and  after randomization another
\Sexpr{flow$Ctrl} (do-nothing), \Sexpr{flow$APC} (APC), and \Sexpr{flow$Trt} (E-E video)
were lost for unknown reasons (possibly due  technical reasons such as a lost
internet connection, issues with linking to the video host, YouTube, server complications,
etc).  A total of \Sexpr{fmt(flow$FinalN)} participants completed the trial and
contributed data to the final analysis. 

The majority of participants  reported their residence in the UK
(\Sexpr{res$ctry["United Kingdom"]}\%) or the USA
(\Sexpr{res$ctry["United States"]}\%), and \Sexpr{res$lan["EN"]}\% of participants reported English as their first
language.  The sample was relatively well-educated, with \Sexpr{sum(res$educ[c(3,4)])}\%
having some college education or higher (BA, MA equivalent or PhD).  Table \ref{tab:tab0}
shows the percentage of participants in each arm by age, gender, country of residence,
educational status, and primary language.
