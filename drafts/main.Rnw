\subsection*{Abstract}


\textbf{Background:} Entertainment-education (E-E) media can improve knowledge of
behaviors that protect health. In the era of COVID-19, millions of people can be reached
by E-E media without requiring any physical contact. We have designed a short, wordless,
animated video about protective COVID-19 behaviors---such as social distancing and
frequent hand washing---that can be rapidly distributed through social media channels to a
global audience. The E-E video's effectiveness, however, remains unclear.  

\textbf{Methods:} This is a multi-site, parallel group, randomized controlled trial
comparing the effectiveness of an E-E video on COVID-19 (CoVideo) against  an attention
placebo control (APC) video and  no video (Control). In each arm,  we measured knowledge
about the basic clinical aspects of COVID-19 (clinical knowledge)  and knowledge of behaviors
that prevent COVID-19 spread (knowledge spread). We recruited online participants aged
18--59 years from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and Mexico. 


\textbf{Findings:} Between \Sexpr{res$dates[1]} and \Sexpr{res$dates[2]}, we recruited
\Sexpr{fmt(flow$In)} participants; the final analysis included \Sexpr{fmt(flow$In -
flow$Start)} participants randomly assigned to the Control (\Sexpr{fmt(flow$CtrlN)}) APC
(\Sexpr{fmt(flow$APCN)}), and CoVideo (\Sexpr{fmt(flow$CoVidN)}) arms.  Knowledge in the
Control arm was high: participants correctly answered \Sexpr{fmt(corrects, 1)}\%  of the
clinical knowledge questions, \Sexpr{fmt(correctc, 1)}\% of the knowledge spread
questions, and \Sexpr{fmt(acorrect, 1)}\% of the combined questions. Overall knowledge was
higher in the CoVideo arm, with greater clinical knowledge gains in older participants
(45--59 years).  Adjusting for demographic factors, knowledge scores were higher among
women, more educated participants, and German speaking residents. After removing social
desirability bias, \Sexpr{fmtCI("SocialDist")$mn} of participants intended to go out with
their friends despite lockdown restrictions and \Sexpr{fmtCI("StockPile")$mn} intended to
stock up on households supplies for a month.  More positively,  \Sexpr{fmtCI("Wash")$mn}
of participants  in the Control arm intended to wash their hands frequently. Behavioral
intentions differed by age and gender. 


\textbf{Interpretation:} In a large, online randomized trial, we found high levels  of
COVID-19 knowledge. Even with high baseline levels, the CoVideo intervention was effective
in increasing basic clinical knowledge of COVID-19 and knowledge of behaviors to prevent
COVID-19 spread. Our results support the use of E-E media on social media platforms to
distribute COVID-19 information to many people on a rapid scale without requiring physical
contact. 

\textbf{Funding:}
This study is funded by the Alexander von Humboldt University Professor Prize.

\subsection*{Introduction}

A large amount of published health information about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has
been disseminated by the traditional mass media since the outbreak of the
pandemic.\autocite{Cinelli2020,Kouzy2020,Mian2020a} However, it is not clear if this
information has improved knowledge and intent toward preventative COVID-19 practices. By
preventative practices, we mean the public's adoption of health behaviors, such as social
distancing, reduced physical contact, and hand sanitization (among others), that
can prevent or reduce the spread of COVID-19. 

Arguably, one possible limitation of mainstream mass media is that it has been perceived
as politicized and culturally localized, thus limiting the persuasiveness of health
messages about COVID-19.\autocite{Garfin2020a, Garrett2020} It is also likely
that traditional mass media channels (e.g., local or national television networks) have
missed key segments of the population, such as young people (18--35 years) who are
disproportionately more likely to transmit the virus to older people ($\geq$ 50
years).\autocite{Zhao2020} An effective public health response could therefore benefit
from focused entertainment-education (E-E) approaches that increase knowledge and
behavioral intent toward preventative COVID-19 practices.\autocite{Hahn2020} 

To improve knowledge and behavioral intent toward preventative COVID-19 practices, we have
designed an animated, wordless, video (abbreviated to CoVideo) that can be rapidly
distributed to a diverse and global audience through social media
channels.\autocite{Adam2020} With a short duration (approximately 2.30 minutes), the
CoVideo contains no speech and minimizes cultural signifiers to increase universality and
appeal. The CoVideo was released on Stanford Medicine's YouTube channel on March 21,
2020, and went viral within 24 hours.  After ten days, it had reached 332,000 views on
YouTube, 220,000 views on Instagram, 294,000 views on Facebook, and 402,000 views on
Twitter, with a cumulative count of 1.2 million views.\autocite{Adam2020} However, it is
unclear if the CoVideo can improve knowledge and intent toward preventative
COVID-19 behaviors.

We used a randomized controlled trial to compare the  effectiveness of the CoVideo against
an attention placebo control (APC) video and no video (Control) in an online setting.  For
our primary aim, we measured knowledge about the clinical aspects of COVID-19 and
knowledge about behaviors that can prevent the spread of COVID-19. For our secondary aim,
we used a list experiment to reduce social desirability bias and accurately measure intent
toward preventative COVID-19 behaviors.  The study results will inform the design of future
E-E videos to disseminate evidence-based health recommendations related to COVID-19 as
well as other public health emergencies.   


\subsection*{Methods}

\paragraph{Study design and participants} 

This was a multi-site, parallel group, randomized controlled trial  comparing the
effectiveness of the CoVideo (the Intervention arm) against an APC video (the Placebo arm)
and no video (the Control arm).\autocite{Vandormael2020b} Each trial arm consisted of
three components: 1) a video intervention (the CoVideo, APC video, or no video), 2) a list
experiment, and 3) survey questions about COVID-19 knowledge.  We used an online platform
called Prolific Academic (\url{https://www.prolific.co}) to recruit participants from the
United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and Mexico. ProA recruited on a ``first
come, first served'' basis and participants had to be 18 to 59 years of age (male, female,
or other) and have current residence in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany,
Spain, Mexico, or France.  Participants were excluded from the study if they could not
speak English, German, or Spanish. The trial was hosted and deployed on Gorillaâ„¢
(\url{www.gorilla.sc}), which is a cloud platform that provides versatile tools to
undertake online, experimental, and behavioral research.\autocite{Anwyl-Irvine2020}  The
study and its outcomes were registered at the German Clinical Trials Register
(www.drks.de) on May 12th, 2020: \#DRKS00021582. Ethical approval was obtained from the
Stanford University IRB on April 12, 2020, \#55820.    

\paragraph{Randomization and masking}

Randomization was at a 1:1:1 ratio for the three arms of the trial.  Nested within each
arm of the trial was a list experiment. Participants were randomized at a 1:1 ratio to a
control or treatment list. Because ProA handled the
interaction between the study investigators and participants, the participants were
completely anonymous to the study investigators. Only the participant's unique,
anonymized ID were used to manage the linking between the ProA and Gorilla platforms. The
outcome measures were self-reported and submitted anonymously. The study investigators and
those involved in the data analyses and statistics were blinded to the group allocation.  


\paragraph{Procedures}

The study design is shown in Figure \ref{fig:design}.
Participants began the online study by answering basic demographic questions about their
age, sex, primary language, country of residence, and highest education completed.

Participants were then randomized to the Intervention, Placebo, or Control arms.
Participants in the Intervention arm received the CoVideo. The CoVideo is an animated
video with sound effects, and has no words, speech, or text.  It shows how the novel
coronavirus is spread (airborne, physical contact) and recommends best practices to
prevent or reduce the spread of COVID-19 (staying at home, not congregating in public
spaces, and sanitizing hands/surfaces). The CoVideo also covers the mass media coverage of
the outbreak and the public's response to this media coverage, which includes a subplot on
the stockpiling of essential goods, and the impact thereof on health-care services and
resources (e.g., doctors being unable to access protective equipment). The CoVideo, which
can be viewed at \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAj38E7vrS8}, was designed for
universal reach and optimized for release on social media channels. 


Participants in the Placebo arm received the APC. The APC video is similar in style to the
CoVideo; it is also animated with a duration of 2.30 minutes, has sound effects but no
words, speech, or text. The video message is about how small choices become actions, which
become habits, which become a way of life
(\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HEnohs6yYw}).  We included an APC to account for
attention effects. APC conditions should mimic the ``inactive'' components of an
interventionâ€”the effect of watching the video---while not containing any of the
``active'' intervention components---the message delivered by the
video.\autocite{Freedland2011} We did not make the assumption that the CoVideo is better
than nothing (i.e., no video). It is possible that the CoVideo could motivate reactance to
the CoVideo message.\autocite{Dillard2005,Miller2007, Richards2015} Participants in the
Control arm received no video. 

Participants in each arm participated in a list experiment. There were five
list experiments in each arm. Each list experiment had a control list of five statements
about intent toward behaviors unrelated to COVID-19 (Table \ref{tab:items}). Each list
experiment also included  a treatment list, which included the same five control items
plus a statement about behavioral intent toward preventative COVID-19 practices.  The five
list experiments covered the topics of social distancing, washing hands, cleaning
surfaces, sharing utensils, and stockpiling essential goods. Items in each list were
randomly ordered and the five list experiments were presented in random order to avoid
order effects. For each list, the minimum score is zero and the maximum score for the
control list is five and six for the treatment list (there are five items in the control
list and six items in the treatment list). We designed the items to minimize ceiling and
floor effects.\autocite{Corstange2009} We used the list experiment to reduce response bias
associated with socially desirable answers to COVID-19 questions.   

After the list experiment, participants answered two types of COVID-19 knowledge
questions.  \textit{Clinical knowledge} of COVID-19, which included 10 items to evaluate
the participants' basic knowledge of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 (Table
\ref{tab:know}). \textit{Knowledge spread}, which included 8 items to evaluate the
particpants' knowledge of practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These items were
prefaced by the phrase: `An effective way to prevent COVID-19 spead'. All items required
True/False responses and all participants received the 18 knowledge items. 

Participants in the APC and Control arms received the CoVideo to ensure post-trial access
to treatment.\autocite{Doval2015}


\paragraph{Outcomes}

The primary outcomes were the mean scores of two sets of  COVID-19 knowledge items.
The  secondary outcome was the proportion of participants that agreed with five
behavioral statements about COVID-19.


\paragraph{Statistical analysis}

We obtained means and standard deviations of the participant's age, gender, primary
language, country of residence, and education status. Using linear regression, we
quantified the difference in mean scores for the clinical knowledge (10 items), knowledge
spread (8 items), and combined knowledge scores (18 items) between the CoVideo, APC, and
Control arms. We calculated the difference between the CoVideo and Control arms as the
Total Effect, the difference between the APC and Control arms as the Attention Effect, and
the difference between the CoVideo and APC arms as the Treatment Effect. For participants
in the Control arm, we used a linear regression model to quantify the effects of the
demographic characteristics on the clinical knowledge, knowledge spread, and overall
knowledge scores.  For each list experiment, we used linear regression to obtain the
difference in means for the experiment list and the control list in the Control arm only.
Statistical analyses were performed with R software version 4.2.


\paragraph{Role of the funding source}

The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data
interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all
the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for
publication.

\subsection*{Results}


Between \Sexpr{res$dates[1]} and \Sexpr{res$dates[2]}, we recruited \Sexpr{fmt(flow$In)}
participants through the Prolific Academic platform. A total of  \Sexpr{fmt(flow$In -
flow$Start)} participants were randomly assigned to the Control (\Sexpr{fmt(flow$CtrlN)})
APC (\Sexpr{fmt(flow$APCN)}), and CoVideo (\Sexpr{fmt(flow$CoVidN)}) arms (Figure
\ref{fig:dataflow}).  Between recruitment and randomization, \Sexpr{flow$Start}
participants were lost.  After randomization to each arm, another \Sexpr{flow$Ctrl}
(Control), \Sexpr{flow$APC} (APC), and \Sexpr{flow$Trt} (CoVideo) participants were lost
due to technical reasons.  A total of \Sexpr{fmt(flow$FinalN)} participants completed the
trial and contributed data to the final analysis. 

The majority of participants  reported their residence in the United Kingdom
(\Sexpr{res$ctry["United Kingdom"]}\%) or the United States (\Sexpr{res$ctry["United States"]}\%), and \Sexpr{res$lan["EN"]}\% of participants reported English as their first
language.  The sample was relatively well-educated, with \Sexpr{sum(res$educ[c(3,4)])}\%
having some college education or higher (BA, MA equivalent or PhD).  Table
\ref{tab:tab0} shows the percentage of participants in each arm by age, gender, country of
residence, educational status, and primary language. 




For the primary aim, the CoVideo arm had a higher overall knowledge score when compared
with the Control and APC arms (Figure \ref{fig:knowall}). In the Control arm,
\Sexpr{fmt(res_all$means["VideoArmControl"], 2)} out of \Sexpr{an} items
(\Sexpr{fmt(res_all$means["VideoArmControl"]/an*100, 2)}\%) were correctly answered.
With this high baseline score, the CoVideo could
therefore only increase knowledge by a maximum of \Sexpr{fmt(amax, 2)} points.  
Relative to the Control arm, the CoVideo increased the average response by
\Sexpr{fmt(adiff, 2)} points (\Sexpr{(res_all$pvals[2, 1])}), which represents a
\Sexpr{fmt(adiff, 2)}/\Sexpr{fmt(amax, 2)} $=$ \Sexpr{fmt(adiff/amax*100, 2)}
percentage point increase in knowledge. The average score for the APC arm was
\Sexpr{fmt(res_all$means["VideoArmPlacebo"],2)}, a correct response rate of
\Sexpr{fmt(res_all$means["VideoArmPlacebo"]/an*100, 2)}\% .  When we removed the
attention effect of the video medium, the CoVideo increased overall knowledge by
\Sexpr{fmt(adiff2, 2)} points (\Sexpr{res_all$pvals[2,2]}), which represents a
\Sexpr{fmt(adiff2, 2)}/\Sexpr{fmt(amax2, 2)} $=$ \Sexpr{fmt(adiff2/amax2*100, 2)}
percentage point increase. 





We report that clinical knowledge was higher among participants that watched the CoVideo
when compared with participants assigned to the APC and Control arms (Figure
\ref{fig:clinic}). In the Control arm, the average items correctly answered was
\Sexpr{fmt(res_know$means["VideoArmControl"], 2)} out of \Sexpr{kn} (a correct response
rate of \Sexpr{fmt(corrects, 1)}\%).  With this high baseline score, the CoVideo could
therefore only increase knowledge by a maximum of \Sexpr{fmt(kmax, 2)} points.  Relative
to the Control arm, the CoVideo increased the average response by \Sexpr{fmt(kdiff, 2)}
points (\Sexpr{(res_know$pvals[2, 1])}), which represents a \Sexpr{fmt(kdiff,
2)}/\Sexpr{fmt(kmax, 2)} $=$ \Sexpr{fmt(kdiff/kmax*100, 1)} percentage point increase in
knowledge. The mean knowledge score for the APC arm was
\Sexpr{fmt(res_know$means["VideoArmPlacebo"], 2)}  points. When we removed the attention
effect of the video medium, the CoVideo increased the average response by
\Sexpr{fmt(kdiff2, 2)} (\Sexpr{res_know$pvals[2,2]}), which represents a
\Sexpr{fmt(kdiff2, 2)}/\Sexpr{fmt(kmax2, 2)} $=$ \Sexpr{fmt(kdiff2/kmax2*100, 1)}
percentage point increase in clinical knowledge.  There was no difference
in knowledge spread among the arms (Figure \ref{fig:spread}). In the Control arm, the
average items correctly answered was \Sexpr{fmt(res_spr$means["VideoArmControl"], 2)} out
of \Sexpr{kns}, a high correct response rate of \Sexpr{fmt(correctc, 1)}\%.

For the clinical knowledge questions, more than \Sexpr{getMin(tabc, "SpreadHealthy")}\%
knew that the coronavirus could be infected by a healthy person even if they looked
healthy, more than \Sexpr{getMin(tabc, "Cough")}\% knew that some people with COVID-19
infection may experience a cough, and more than \Sexpr{getMin(tabc, "TouchFace")}\% knew
that you can catch COVID-19 by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your
face.  The lowest correctly answered item (\Sexpr{getMin(tabc, "CleanSoap")}\%) was
knowing that cleaning surfaces with soap and water is an effective way to kill the
coronavirus.  For the knowledge spread questions, more than \Sexpr{getMin(tabs,
"WashHandSoap")}\% of participants knew that an effective way to prevent COVID-19 spread
is to wash hands frequently with soap and water; and \Sexpr{getMin(tabs,
"NoShakeHands")}\% of participants knew that an effective way to prevent COVID-19 spread
is to avoid shaking hands with other people, and to avoid places that are crowded with
people (like bars, restaurants or performances), respectively. On the lower end,
\Sexpr{getMin(tabs, "RinseSalt")}\%  answered correctly that regularly rinsing your nose
with salt water cannot prevent the spread of COVID-19. 

Table \ref{tab:modc}  shows the regression results for clinic knowledge items (Control arm
only). Older participants (aged 25--54 years) had higher knowledge scores than younger
participants (aged 18-24 years). Women had higher knowledge scores than men and German
speaking residents  the highest knowledge scores, after controlling for other factors.
Results show that higher education was significantly associated with higher knowledge
scores, with a clear dose response across the education levels.  For the knowledge spread
items, education level was also associated with higher knowledge (Table \ref{tab:mods}).


When compared with the Control arm, the CoVideo increased clinical knowledge 
most in the 45--54 year age group (Mean Diff.=\Sexpr{agediff$c4554[1]},
\Sexpr{agediff$c4554[3]}) and 55-59 year age group (Mean Diff.$=$\Sexpr{agediff$c5559[1]},
\Sexpr{agediff$c5559[3]}). The third largest increase was in the 18--24 year age group
(Mean Diff.=\Sexpr{agediff$c1824[1]}, \Sexpr{agediff$c1824[3]}). There was no
statistically significant difference in knowledge spread of COVID-19 among the Control and
CoVideo arms by age group. 




For the secondary aim, we measured agreement with behavioral statements about COVID-19.
Figure \ref{fig:behav} shows the percentage of participants that agreed with the five
statements, after removing social desirability bias through the list experiment, which is
a baseline measure of behavioral intent.  Participants showed relatively high behavioral
intent to wash their hands frequently (\Sexpr{fmtCI("Wash")$both}), with lower intent to
clean dishes after use (\Sexpr{fmtCI("CleanDishes")$both}) and clean kitchen counters
after use (\Sexpr{fmtCI("CleanSurfaces")$both}). Results show that
\Sexpr{fmtCI("StockPile")$mn} of participants intended to stockpile household supplies for
a month (\Sexpr{fmtCI("StockPile")$ci}) and \Sexpr{fmtCI("SocialDist")$mn} said they would
go out with friends even though lockdown restrictions were likely in place
(\Sexpr{fmtCI("SocialDist")$ci}). 

Figure \ref{fig:soc}  shows the differences in behavioral intent by age and gender for
each of the five statements. For the social distancing statement, younger men (aged 18-24
years) and older men (aged 45-59 years) were more likely than their female counterparts to
go out with friends. With the exception of the 45--54 year age group, more men intended
to stockpile household supplies for the next month when compared with women.  Older
men and women were more likely to clean their dishes after use to prevent the spread of
COVID-19. Most participants agreed that they will wash their hands frequently in the next
week. 


\subsection*{Discussion}


There is a critical need for public health actors to disseminate scientific information
about the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. To inform the public about the prevention
of COVID-19 spread, we produced a short, animated video that went viral in the first week
of its release on social media.\autocite{Adam2020}  To evaluate the CoVideo's
effectiveness, we recruited \Sexpr{fmt(flow$FinalN)} participants to take part in a
multi-site, parallel group, randomized controlled trial in an online setting.  We asked
participants knowledge questions about the basic clinical characteristics of COVID-19
(clinical knowledge) and knowledge of behaviors to prevent the spread of COVID-19
(knowledge spread).  We also used a list experiment in the Control arm to remove social
desirability bias and obtain a baseline measure of intent to adhere to
preventative COVID-19 behaviors. 


We report that participants in our study had high levels of COVID-19 knowledge.  For
example, \Sexpr{getMin(tabc, "SpreadHealthy")}\% of participants in the Control arm knew
that the coronavirus could be infected by a person even if they looked healthy,
\Sexpr{getMin(tabc, "Cough")}\% knew that some people with COVID-19 infection may
experience a cough, and \Sexpr{getMin(tabc, "TouchFace")}\% knew that you can catch
COVID-19 by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your face.  Overall,
participants in the Control arm correctly answered \Sexpr{fmt(corrects, 1)}\% of the
clinical knowledge questions, \Sexpr{fmt(correctc, 1)}\% of the knowledge spread
questions, and \Sexpr{fmt(acorrect, 1)}\% of the combined questions.  Given such high
baseline levels, the CoVideo was nevertheless effective at increasing basic knowledge of the
clinical characteristics of COVID-19:   out of the remaining \Sexpr{fmt(100 - corrects,
1)}\% needed to achieve a 100\% correct response rate, the CoVideo increased clinical
knowledge by a further \Sexpr{fmt(kdiff/kmax*100, 1)}\%. After adjusting for attention effects, the
increase in clinical knowledge was \Sexpr{fmt(kdiff2/kmax2*100, 1)}\%.  

Results show that there was no difference in knowledge about how to prevent the spread of
COVID-19. There are two likely explanations for this result. The first is that the
baseline level of knowledge in the Control arm was very high (\Sexpr{fmt(correctc, 1)}\%):
the CoVideo could therefore not improve the baseline knowledge spread scores any further.
The second explanation is that educating people about the clinical features of a disease
(such as COVID-19) is different to educating them about health behaviors to prevent the
disease (in this case, practices to prevent COVID-19 spread). This second explanation is
related to the use of knowledge to promote health behavior change, which is often
difficult to achieve in practice.\autocite{Ajzen2011a} Additional analyses may be needed
to determine which of the two explanations best fits the data. 
 
The knowledge scores differed by several factors. In the Control and CoVideo arms,
participants with higher educational status had higher COVID-19 knowledge scores, and
women scored higher than men. Of the five countries, Germany had the highest knowledge
scores after adjusting for age, gender, and education level.  Because of its short,
animated format designed for social media release, we expected the CoVideo to increase
knowledge most in the younger age group (18--24 years). But the CoVideo increased
knowledge most  in the older age groups (45-54 and 54-59 years), which is a surprising
finding. This result remains even after removing the attention effects of the video
format. Given these findings, online E-E videos about health could be an important means
to target older populations who are often more vulnerable to health issues, as the
recent COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated.


We  also measured baseline levels of behavioral intent toward preventative COVID-19
practices.  Given the unprecedented nature of the pandemic, and the media attention it has
received, we assumed that participants would be primed to give socially acceptable
responses to COVID-19 questions. To get around the problem of eliciting untruthful answers
to socially desirable questions, we used a list experiment in the Control arm. The list
experiment rationale and methodology is described in detail elsewhere.\autocite{Glynn2013,
Corstange2009, Chou2020}  Results show that \Sexpr{fmtCI("SocialDist")$mn} of participants
intended to go out with their friends despite lockdown and social distancing restrictions.
Furthermore, despite calls from public officials, \Sexpr{fmtCI("StockPile")$mn} intended
to stock up on households supplies for a month. More positively, after removing social
desirability bias, \Sexpr{fmtCI("Wash")$mn} of participants  in the Control arm intended
to wash their hands frequently. This last result indicates that participants in the study
sample had high behavioral intent to protect themselves from COVID-19 infection and to
reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread. 


Our study has several strengths.  First, we  used state-of-the-art online technology to
implement our randomized controlled trial.\autocite{Vandormael2020b} The Prolific Academic
platform enabled us to rapidly recruit a large number of participants who speak different
languages and live in different countries in Europe, North America, and Latin America.
This online recruitment resource enabled us to evaluate the effectiveness of the CoVideo
across a diverse audience on a truly global scale.  Second, we  implemented our study on
the Gorilla platform, which is designed to host and facilitate experimental and online
trials in behavioral research.\autocite{Anwyl-Irvine2020} The Gorilla platform enabled us
to implement a multi-site, parallel group RCT with randomization to the CoVideo, APC, or
Control arms, as well as to implement a list randomization experiment in each arm. Within
each list experiment, the list items were randomly ordered and the list experiments were
randomly ordered to avoid order effects. All randomization was done by Gorilla's
randomization algorithm,  demonstrating the platform's potential to implement
innovative trial designs and concepts.  

Our study results demonstrate the potential of E-E media, such as a short, animated video
format, that can  be rapidly and comprehensively distributed to improve knowledge about an
important public health topic.  We expect that our study will make important contributions
to the E-E literature.  These lessons can improve the design of E-E videos to disseminate
public health information for future pandemics.  Our results will also guide future E-E
strategies to support the long-term COVID-19 response as countries begin to ease lock-down
restrictions.
