\subsection*{Introduction}

A large amount of published health information about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has
been disseminated by the traditional mass media since the outbreak of the
pandemic.\autocite{Cinelli2020,Kouzy2020,Mian2020a} However, it is not clear if this
information has improved knowledge of preventive COVID-19 behaviours. By preventive
behaviours, we mean the public's adoption of practices such as social distancing, reduced
physical contact, and hand sanitation (among others) that can prevent the spread of
COVID-19. 

Arguably, one possible limitation of mainstream mass media is that it has been perceived
as politicized and culturally localized, thus limiting the persuasiveness of health
messages about COVID-19.\autocite{Garfin2020a, Garrett2020} It is also likely that
traditional mass media channels (e.g., local or national television networks) have missed
key segments of the population, such as young people (18--35 years) who are
disproportionately more likely to transmit the virus to older people ($\geq$ 50
years).\autocite{Dowd2020, Harris2020, Zhao2020} An effective public health response could
therefore benefit from entertainment-education (E-E) approaches that reach a wide
age-range and focus on behaviours to prevent COVID-19 spread.\autocite{Hahn2020, Block2020} 

To improve knowledge about preventive COVID-19 behaviours, we have designed a wordless,
animated E-E video that can be rapidly distributed to a diverse and
global audience through social media channels.\autocite{Adam2020} With a short duration
(2.30 minutes), the E-E video contains no speech and minimizes cultural identifiers to
increase universality and appeal. The E-E video was released on Stanford Medicine's YouTube
channel on March 21, 2020, and accumulated a large number of views (`went viral') within
24 hours.  After ten days, it had reached 332,000 views on YouTube, 220,000 views on
Instagram, 294,000 views on Facebook, and 402,000 views on Twitter, with a cumulative
count of 1.2 million views.\autocite{Adam2020} 

Using a randomized controlled trial, we evaluate the E-E video's effectiveness to improve
COVID-19 preventive knowledge   among online participants from the United States (US),
Mexico, the United Kingdom (UK), Germany, and Spain. The comparators are an attention
placebo control (APC) video and do-nothing.  Our study results will inform the design of
future E-E videos to disseminate evidence-based health recommendations related to COVID-19
as well as other public health emergencies.   


\subsection*{Methods}

\paragraph{Study design and participants} 

This was a multi-site, parallel group, randomized controlled trial  comparing the
effectiveness of the E-E video  against an APC video and
do-nothing.\autocite{Vandormael2020b} We used an online platform called Prolific Academic
(\url{https://www.prolific.co}) to recruit participants, who selected to enter the study
on a ``first come, first served'' basis. Participants had to be between the ages of 18 and
59 years (male, female, or other) and have current residence in the US, the UK, Germany,
Spain, or Mexico.  Participants were excluded from the study if they could not speak
English, German, or Spanish. The trial was hosted and deployed on Gorilla™
(\url{www.gorilla.sc}), which is a cloud platform that provides versatile tools to
undertake online, experimental, and behavioural research.\autocite{Anwyl-Irvine2020} The
study and its outcomes were registered at the German Clinical Trials Register
(www.drks.de) on May 12th, 2020: \#DRKS00021582. Ethical approval was obtained from the
Stanford University IRB on April 12, 2020, \#55820.    

\paragraph{Randomization and masking}

Randomization was at a 1:1:1 ratio for the three arms of the trial.  Because Prolific
Academic handled the interaction between the study investigators and participants, the
participants were completely anonymous to the study investigators. Participants
self-responded to the survey questions and self-submitted their responses anonymously on
the Gorilla platform. The study investigators and those involved in the data analyses 
were blinded to the group  allocation.  


\paragraph{Procedures}

Participants began the online study on the Gorilla platform by answering basic demographic
questions about their age, sex, primary language, country of residence, and highest
education completed.

Participants were  then randomly assigned by Gorilla to the E-E video, APC, or do-nothing.
The E-E video is a wordless, animated video about how the novel coronavirus is spread
(airborne, physical contact), and recommends best practices to prevent or reduce the
spread of COVID-19 (staying at home, not congregating in public spaces, and sanitizing
hands/surfaces). It also covers the mass media coverage of the epidemic and a subplot
about the stockpiling of essential goods
(\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAj38E7vrS8}). 


The APC is a wordless, animated video that has the same duration as the E-E video.  Its
message is about how small choices become actions, which become habits, which become a way
of life (\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HEnohs6yYw}).  We included an APC to
account for possible attention effects elicited by the video medium. APC conditions should
mimic the ``inactive'' components of an intervention—the effect of watching the
video---while not containing any of the ``active'' intervention components---the message
delivered by the video.\autocite{Freedland2011} We did not make the assumption that the
E-E video is better than nothing (i.e., no video). It is possible that the E-E video could
arouse reactance to the COVID-19 prevention message.\autocite{Dillard2005,Miller2007,
Richards2015} Participants in the control arm received no video. 


Participants answered 18 COVID-19 knowledge questions. The 18 knowledge items are shown in
Table \ref{tab:know}.  All items required True/False responses and all participants
received the knowledge items. As a way to prevent online searchers for the answers,
participants were given a count-down of 30 seconds to respond to each item 

To ensure post-trial access to treatment,\autocite{Doval2015} participants in the APC and
control arm were given the option to watch the E-E video at the end of the study. 


\paragraph{Statistical analysis}


The primary outcome was the mean number of correct responses to the 18 knowledge items.
For each participant, we created an overall knowledge score (minimum $=$ 0, maximum $=$
18) by adding the correctly answered items. We used an ordinary least squares (OLS)
regression to estimate the mean knowledge score by trial arm and to estimate the
difference in knowledge scores between trial arms. We defined the difference in knowledge
score between the E-E video and control arm as the total effect, the difference between
the APC and control arm as the attention effect, and the difference between the E-E video
and APC arm as the content effect.  We also summarized the participant characteristics
by obtaining means and standard deviations of age, gender, primary
language, country of residence, and education status.  Statistical analyses were performed
with R software version 4.2.


\paragraph{Role of the funding source}

The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data
interpretation, or writing of the report. The corresponding author had full access to all
the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit for
publication.

\subsection*{Results}


Between \Sexpr{res$dates[1]} and \Sexpr{res$dates[2]}, we enrolled \Sexpr{fmt(flow$In)}
participants through the Prolific Academic platform. A total of  \Sexpr{fmt(flow$In -
flow$Start)} participants were randomly assigned to the E-E video
(\Sexpr{fmt(flow$CoVidN)}), APC (\Sexpr{fmt(flow$APCN)}), and control
(\Sexpr{fmt(flow$CtrlN)}) arms (Figure \ref{fig:dataflow}).  Between recruitment and
randomization, \Sexpr{flow$Start} participants were lost and  after randomization another
\Sexpr{flow$Ctrl} (control), \Sexpr{flow$APC} (APC), and \Sexpr{flow$Trt} (E-E video)
were lost for unknown reasons (possibly due  technical reasons such as a lost
internet connection, issues with linking to the video host, YouTube, server complications,
etc).  A total of \Sexpr{fmt(flow$FinalN)} participants completed the trial and
contributed data to the final analysis. 

The majority of participants  reported their residence in the United Kingdom
(\Sexpr{res$ctry["United Kingdom"]}\%) or the United States (\Sexpr{res$ctry["United States"]}\%), and \Sexpr{res$lan["EN"]}\% of participants reported English as their first
language.  The sample was relatively well-educated, with \Sexpr{sum(res$educ[c(3,4)])}\%
having some college education or higher (BA, MA equivalent or PhD).  Table \ref{tab:tab0}
shows the percentage of participants in each arm by age, gender, country of residence,
educational status, and primary language. 

The E-E video significantly increased our primary endpoint, with higher knowledge in the
E-E video arm compared with the APC and do-nothing arms (Figure \ref{fig:knowall}). In the
do-nothing arm, \Sexpr{fmt(know_res$means["VideoArmControl"], 2)} out of the \Sexpr{an}
items (\Sexpr{fmt(know_res$means["VideoArmControl"]/an*100, 2)}\%) were correctly
answered.  With this high baseline score, the E-E video could therefore only increase
knowledge by a maximum of \Sexpr{fmt(amax, 2)} points.  Relative to the do-nothing arm,
the E-E video increased knowledge by \Sexpr{fmt(adiff, 2)} points
(\Sexpr{(know_res$totdiff$pval)}), which represents a \Sexpr{fmt(adiff,
2)}/\Sexpr{fmt(amax, 2)} $=$ \Sexpr{fmt(adiff/amax*100, 2)} percentage point increase. The
average score for the APC arm was \Sexpr{fmt(know_res$means["VideoArmPlacebo"],2)}, a
correct response rate of \Sexpr{fmt(know_res$means["VideoArmPlacebo"]/an*100, 2)}\%.  When
we removed the attention effect of the video format, the E-E video increased overall
knowledge by \Sexpr{fmt(adiff2, 2)} points (\Sexpr{know_res$contdiff$pval}), which
represents a \Sexpr{fmt(adiff2, 2)}/\Sexpr{fmt(amax2, 2)} $=$ \Sexpr{fmt(adiff2/amax2*100,
2)} percentage point increase. 

Knowledge was high.

As post-access to treatment, participants in the APC and control arms ($n =
\Sexpr{fmt(sum(table(dat_all$VideoArm)[-3]))}$) were given the choice to watch the
E-E video. Of these participants, \Sexpr{fmt(leftwatch)} were able to access the E-E video
without any technical issues (e.g., failure to be redirected to the YouTube site where the
E-E video was hosted, poor download connection, slow internet). From this number,
\Sexpr{round(watched*100, 1)}\% chose to watch the E-E video and \Sexpr{round(less150*100,
1)}\% watched to the end.




\subsection*{Discussion}


There is a critical need for public health actors to disseminate scientific information
about the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. To inform the public about the prevention
of COVID-19 spread, we produced a short, animated video that went viral on social media in
the first week of its release.\autocite{Adam2020}  To evaluate the E-E video's
effectiveness, we recruited \Sexpr{fmt(flow$In)} participants to take part in a
multi-site, parallel group, randomized controlled trial in an online setting.  We asked
participants to answer questions about behaviours to prevent the spread of COVID-19.  Our
primary aim was to assess if the E-E video was effective in improving knowledge about
behaviours that can prevent the spread of  COVID-19. 


We report that participants in our study had high levels of COVID-19 knowledge.  For
example, \Sexpr{getMin(tabc, "SpreadHealthy")}\% of participants in the control arm knew
that the coronavirus could be infected by a person even if they looked healthy,
\Sexpr{getMin(tabc, "Cough")}\% knew that some people with COVID-19 infection may
experience a cough, and \Sexpr{getMin(tabc, "TouchFace")}\% knew that you can catch
COVID-19 by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your face.  

<<eval = FALSE>>=

#Overall,
#participants in the control arm correctly answered \Sexpr{fmt(corrects, 1)}\% of the
#clinical knowledge questions, \Sexpr{fmt(correctc, 1)}\% of the knowledge spread
#questions, and \Sexpr{fmt(acorrect, 1)}\% of the combined questions.  These high scores
#could reflect the relatively well educated status of our online sample, with
#\Sexpr{sum(res$educ[c(3,4)])}\% having some college education or higher (BA, MA equivalent
#or PhD).

@

It is possible that our sample was more educated than the general populations of
the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, and Mexico.  Nevetheless, our study
shows a similar educational composition to a recent study on COVID-19 knowledge in
the United States and Great Britain, where 76\% of the online sample had some college education
or higher.\autocite{Geldsetzer2020}



<<eval = FALSE>>=

#Given the already high basline knowledge levels, the E-E video was effective at increasing
#knowledge of the basic clinical characteristics of COVID-19.   Out of the remaining
#\Sexpr{fmt(100 - corrects, 1)}\% margin needed to achieve a 100\% correct response rate,
#the E-E video increased clinical knowledge by a further \Sexpr{fmt(kdiff/kmax*100, 1)}\%.
#After adjusting for attention effects, the increase in this clinical knowledge was
#\Sexpr{fmt(kdiff2/kmax2*100, 1)}\%.  However, there was no difference across the trial
#arms in knowledge of behaviours to prevent COVID-19 spread. There are two likely
#explanations for this result.  First, the E-E video could not improve the high knowledge
#spread scores (\Sexpr{fmt(correctc, 1)}\%) any further.  Second, the E-E video may have been
#more effective in improving knowledge about the basic clinical characteristics of COVID-19
#than knowledge about behaviours to prevent COVID-19 spread. More generally and
#in practice, it may be easier to improve knowledge about the clinical features of a
#disease  when compared to improving knowledge about health behaviours to prevent that
#disease.\autocite{Ajzen2011a} Where possible, additional analyses may be needed to
#determine which of the two explanations best fits the data.

Our study has several strengths.  We  used state-of-the-art online technology to implement
our randomized controlled trial.\autocite{Vandormael2020b} Through the Prolific Academic
platform, we rapidly  recruited a large number of participants who speak different
languages and live in different countries in Europe, North America, and Latin America.  We
also hosted our study on the Gorilla platform, which provides services for the design,
implementation, and management of  online trials in behavioural
research.\autocite{Anwyl-Irvine2020} Gorilla has ready-made tools for randomization to the
trial arms, blinding, prevention of repeat or duplicate participants, bot checks,
questionnaire builders, and count-downs (time limits), which we used to prevent
respondents from searching for online answers to the knowledge questions. Together, these
tools enabled us to rapidly recruit online participants and ensure the rigour  of a
completely randomized controlled design.


As an additional strength of this study, we were able to measure participant engagement
with the E-E video intervention.  To ensure post-access to treatment, we offered
participants in the APC and control arms the option to watch the E-E video.  We used Gorilla
tools to  record whether participants' clicked ``End the study'' or ``Watch the video''
and also recorded the time spent watching the E-E video.  Our preliminary results show a
relatively high engagement with the E-E video: of the \Sexpr{round(watched*100)}\%
participants that chose to watch, \Sexpr{round(less150*100, 1)}\% watched to the end.
This engagement is interesting given that respondents already knew most of the COVID-19
facts featured in the E-E video. It is plausible that the APC and control arm participants
believed they could benefit from watching the E-E video and gain further COVID-19 information.
To this extent, the E-E video may have increased the participants' subjective probability
that their current COVID-19 knowledge was correct.  Finally, it is possible that the
E-E video elicited some form of emotional engagement in  participants, such as giving them
a sense of hope or reassurance. Further E-E studies are needed to measure the
potential for using emotional engagement to sustain attention to health messages.


Our study results demonstrate the potential of E-E media, such as a short, animated video
format that can  be rapidly and comprehensively distributed to improve knowledge about an
important public health topic.  We expect that our study will make important contributions
to the E-E literature.  These lessons can improve the design of E-E videos to disseminate
public health information for future pandemics.  Our results will also guide future E-E
strategies to support the long-term COVID-19 response as countries begin to ease lock-down
restrictions.
